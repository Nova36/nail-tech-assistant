## Brief-fidelity gaps

### Internal `ui-designer` — followed brief faithfully

- All 7 required surfaces present in every rendition
- Inline `:root` block matches `app/globals.css` byte-for-byte (12 brand hexes)
- `data-component` annotations on every region with consistent naming (BoardGrid, BoardCard, BoardGridSkeleton, EmptyBoardsState, InfiniteScrollSentinel, PageHeader, PinterestBoardsPage, PrivateBadge, TokenInvalidPlaceholder)
- Brand palette purity 12/12 — zero NEW colors, zero NEW gradients
- Breakpoint widths exactly `375 / 768 / 1280` per spec
- Tighter HTML structure (3 sections, 8-15 articles, 2 asides) — closer to a real React component tree

### External Claude design — partial adherence, two real misses

- **MISS 1: No inline `:root` token block.** The spec explicitly required pasting `app/globals.css` lines 4-44 into an inline `<style>` so the wireframe color matches the app. Claude design relied on Tailwind defaults + invented some beige variants. Practical impact: **the wireframe palette doesn't perfectly match what the deployed app will look like**, so visual review is misleading.
- **MISS 2: No `data-component` annotations.** The spec called these out specifically to make HTML→React mapping unambiguous. Claude design omitted them entirely. Practical impact: **the developer has to infer component boundaries from `class` strings instead of reading the data attribute** — slower, more error-prone.
- **MISS 3 (minor): NEW hex colors introduced.** v1 added `#e8dfd4`, `#ede4d9`. v2 added `#dcd0c2` on top. v3 added `#d7cbbd`. None of these are in the brand system. The brief said "zero new colors". Claude design slipped in 2-3 cream/beige variants per file.
- **MISS 4 (minor): Breakpoint widths are 390/820 instead of 375/768.** Off-spec but representative — iPhone-13 width vs spec 375px, common tablet sim vs spec 768px. Cosmetic.

### Where Claude design IS stronger

- **Annotation density:** 12 `<aside>` callouts per file vs ui-designer's 2. Claude design treats annotations as a teaching layer; ui-designer treats them as marginal. Either approach is defensible — depends on whether annotations are for the developer (light) or for design review (heavy).
- **Semantic decomposition:** 9 `<section>`s per file vs ui-designer's 3. Claude design splits the page into more discrete semantic regions, which can be easier to skim.
- **More articles in v1:** 21 vs 15. More cards rendered = denser visual sample of how the boards grid will actually look populated.

## Verdict

**Internal ui-designer wins on brief fidelity.** Three checks Claude design missed (inline tokens, data-component annotations, brand-palette purity) are non-negotiable for this comparison's stated goal: "produce wireframes that match the project's actual brand and map cleanly to React components". The internal tool nailed both.

**Claude design wins on annotation density.** If you wanted a more documented, more-explained set of wireframes for design-review purposes (vs developer-handoff), Claude's `<aside>` density is genuinely useful. But for the b2 use case where the next step is the developer agent implementing the React, ui-designer's output is more directly usable.

**Visual quality is not assessed by this report.** Both sets need to be opened in a browser. Auto-detection can confirm structural fidelity but not whether v3 Magazine actually feels editorial vs busy.

## Recommended action

1. **Open both sets in a browser side-by-side.** That's the only way to evaluate the felt-quality bar (warmth, hierarchy, restraint vs over-design).
2. **Pick from one set** — don't mix-and-match across tools, that defeats the comparison.
3. **If the internal ui-designer's set passes the wife-test:** approve one (probably v2 Editorial or v3 Magazine based on typical Pinterest aesthetics, but your call), update the b2 story `wireframes:` block, and unblock the story for execute.
4. **If Claude design's set looks meaningfully better visually despite the brief misses:** flag the misses as known-gap, ask Claude to revise (re-paste the prompt with the misses called out), and re-compare.

- Which file you want approved (path)
- Any small tweaks (one revision cycle)
- Whether to also use this winning approach as the template for b3 + b4 wireframes
